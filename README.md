# 2021 Dutch Grand Prix: HAM vs BOT: fastest laps

This code was shamelessly stolen from [this](https://medium.com/@jaspervhat/analyzing-formula-1-data-using-python-2021-dutch-gp-hamilton-vs-bottas-145945eac278) blog.

This is mostly just a test by me to make sure that I have plenty of examples for future F1 telemetry projects that I hope to do with the `fastf1` python package.
